# PlayerHeads
Spigot plugin that allow get heads killing players and mobs.

This plugin is a refactor of Meiskan's plugin, he is the author of this plugin.
Him repository is https://github.com/meiskam/PlayerHeads.

Most heads are from this page: https://minecraft-heads.com

## Changes
The main change that I added is the mob heads generator. previous of this refactor the heads could not be changeable because with each server restart, a internal code of heads changed.

So there are all mob heads.
